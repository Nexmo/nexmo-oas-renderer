# Setup Event Alerts

You can use a short code to send event alerts or reminders to your users - for example, to remind them of an appointment. The [Event-based alerts API](/api/sms/us-short-codes/alerts/sending) provides this capability. 

> **Note** Our carrier partner (AT&T) is discontinuing its shared short code service for alerts. Nexmo is therefore no longer able to offer this service. [Dedicated short codes](https://www.nexmo.com/platform/short-codes) are still available.

You configure these alerts in the developer dashboard:

1. Sign in to the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).
2. In the left-hand navigation menu, click **Numbers** then **Buy numbers**.
3. Click the **add a shared short code** link.
4. Click the **Add a shortcode for alerting** button.
5. Configure your alert, `HELP` and `STOP` messages and your business information.
6. Click **Update**.
