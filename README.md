## Dependencies


## Installation and Usage

### As a standalone application

Install the gem:

``` shell
$ gem install nexmo-oas-renderer
```

And simply run the executable with the corresponding env variables set (see [Note](#note)):
``` shell
$ nexmo-oas-renderer
```

### Mounted into a Rails Application

Add this to your application's `Gemfile`:

```
gem 'nexmo-oas-renderer', require: false
```

And then run `bundle install`.

Require the gem in `config/environment.rb` as follows:

``` ruby
# Load the Rails application.
require_relative 'application'

require 'nexmo/oas/renderer'

# Initialize the Rails application.
Rails.application.initialize!
```

And finally mount the Sinatra app into your Rails application by adding the following line to `config/routes.rb`:

``` ruby
mount Nexmo::OAS::Renderer::API, at: '/api'
```

### Specifying the path to the documents

This gem uses [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to handle environment variables, so you should copy the `.env.example` provided by running:
``` shell
$ cp .env.example .env
```
and assign values to the corresponding variables.

#### Note
The env variable `OAS_PATH` indicates the path to the documents that will be rendered.
Set `OAS_CI` to true to treat all the OAS docs under `OAS_PATH` as valid.
